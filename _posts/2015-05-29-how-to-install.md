1. First, embrace [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as your static-site generator.
2. Then, clone [the babybindery repo](https://github.com/thedesignoffice/babybindery) and set it up in your directory of choice for local development. ([Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) if you haven’t.)
3. Decide what your content categories should be. We have started you off with “image,” “conversation,” “text,” and “other” (the last of which can really be a catchall). If you want to change these, please see the guide for “How Do I Change The Content Types?”.
4. Hop into the `css` directory and make changes to your body, headings, headers, footers, and so forth. Careful though! Please look at the “Caveats” document for a couple warnings.  
5. Write your posts by working in the `_posts` directory. Make sure to check the posts we’ve provided to get a sense of the front matter you need to write. Then feel free to remove what we included.
6. Once ready to publish, push to a `gh-pages` branch or do whatever necessary for your [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to get working.
