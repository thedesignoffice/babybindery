Babybindery takes a set of categorized content in Jekyll and turns it into a printable book, the styling of which is easily editable. 

Babybindery is a collection of HTML layouts, includes, CSS files, and JS files that are designed to live in a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) repository. The content should be in [_posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). 

We have print.html and print_twocol.html layouts that use [Fremy CSS Regions Polyfill](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-regions-polyfill) to pour the information in your Jekyll Posts collection into a one- or two-column book.

If you’re confident with CSS and know something about Liquid and Jekyll, it is simple to extend Babybindery’s capabilities, or trim it down to the bare essentials. We have done our best to apply minimal and extensible styling, so changes stay tidy.
